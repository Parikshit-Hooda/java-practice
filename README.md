# Java practice

### Notes from Mosh's videos
- In Java, functions by convention have the opening curly brackets on the same line as function declaration.
- A class in Java contains the related functions. 
- Every Java app must have atleast 1 main() function.
- Every class and function must have an access-modifier. Mostly, we use `public`.
- In Java by convention, for naming a class, we use PascalCase. For naming a function, we use camelCase. 
Syntax for summarizing above points.

`public class Main {
public void main() {
}
}
`
